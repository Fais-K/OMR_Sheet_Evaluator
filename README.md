# OMR Sheet Evaluator/Analyzer
This program is capable of analyzing the student details and evaluating the bubbled answers in a standard OMR Sheet. As an output, we get a window displaying the student details and the mark scored for each set of the questions. 
### Imposed Constraints
 - If multiple bubbles are filled for a question, then the first filled bubble from left-to-right will be considered for marking.
 - If no bubbles are filled for a question, then that question will be marked as not attended.
